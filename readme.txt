Consists of a hardware product. 

A wearable robot set of arms. The arms will be in leader mode 
while wearable and follower mode while not on a user.

The goal: Determine the minimum viable hardware.

If you can successfully operate the arms, to produce more economic value 
than the cost of the hardware, then you have succeeded, from a hardware perspective.

You can subtract the value of the human operator's time, 
because the automation of the humans time is a software problem.

How do you calculate the economic value of a task?

You can use the following formula:

Economic Value = (Revenue - Cost) / Time

So what is the economic value of cooking a meal?

While testing the hardware we will generate two data sets. 

The first is raw video of a human doing a task, no robot involvement.
This data will include the raw video.

The second is data from human operating the robot, doing the same task. 
This data will include the servo positions, and the raw video.

We can then map from the raw video of a human moving their arms, 
to the data set of a human operating the robot. 
And then finally to the robot servo positions. 
In this way, we have a mapping from raw video to servo positions.
This allows teleoperation, with the minimum amount of hardware.
