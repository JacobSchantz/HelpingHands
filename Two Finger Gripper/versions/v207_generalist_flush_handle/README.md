# Generalist Gripper · Handle 7: flush handle (Gripper 21)

voice-448df859. Jake (on Handle 6): *"Viewed edge-on, the handle is still too tall. Make the handle about the same height
as the gripper finger itself, not taller."*

Handle 7 is Handle 6 (`v206_generalist_single_step`) with the handle cut down to the finger's height. Fingers are
Gripper 21, unchanged. Edge-on, same camera: `previews/compare_v206_edge.png`.

## What changed from Handle 6

- **The plate is the finger's 12 mm** edge-on (Handle 6: 37, 12.5 mm past each face). Its height is now
  `plate + 2 × handle_over`, Base 3's shared param, with `handle_over` 0 (Base 3: 1.5).
- **Strap tunnel instead of two slots.** There's no room for a slot either side of the finger, so the strap runs
  through Base 3's tunnel: a boss on the plate's outer face (where the digit lies), with a 2.5 mm gap under it that's
  open at both faces of the finger. `slot_gap` is gone; `strap_slot_width` and `slot_wall` now size the tunnel.
- **Stop strip kept, smaller.** It's 0.8 mm wide (Handle 6: 2.0) and sits just past the ventral face, so the plate
  steps down over it there. The handle's ventral edge stands `fit + stop_width` = 1.0 mm past the finger, which makes it
  **13 mm overall**. With `stop_depth` 0 the strip is gone and the handle is exactly 12 mm, but then only friction holds it.

## Checks (all pass)

`python3 export_models.py && python3 genus.py && python3 check_geometry.py`: all of Handle 6's checks, with the handle
genus now 1 (the tunnel), plus `handle_edge_on_height_is_the_finger_plus_the_stop_lip` (y −7.0 to 6.0).

## Not verified

Nothing printed. The tunnel and webbing sizes are nominal (no strap threaded). Handle 6's caveats stand.

# Generalist Gripper · Version 2.6: single step (fingers 1.21)

voice-72840084. Jake (on 1.20 + 2.5): *"Extend the black piece where my finger rests all the way up to where the profile
starts to go out again. Where it goes out again, make it more of a single jump out: no double indent, just out and then
back in."*

2.6 is 2.5 (`v205_generalist_spanning_handle`) with the top hook moved up. Its fingers are **1.21** (gripper only = the
`right`/`left` finger STLs here; there is no separate 1.21 folder). Side by side, same camera: `previews/compare_v205.png`.

## What changed from 2.5

- **The outer edge runs straight up to where it used to go out** (1.21). 1.20's edge had the top hook notch at u 28.4, a
  ramp back in, a ~1 mm dip from u 36 to 56, then the blade-root S-curve climbing out: two indents. Now the edge is one
  straight line from the base hook to the top notch at u 54 (new param `top_notch_u`, replacing `top_hook_mirror_u`).
- **One step out.** At u 54 the mirrored J-hook curls out to its crest (6.6 mm out, same hook as 2.5), and the edge stays
  out there, nearly level (sags 0.3 mm), until the beak's outer edge comes back up to it at about u 77; then the beak
  carries on and rounds back in to the point. New param `top_step_back` (0) lets the back of the step dip and rejoin
  the edge sooner if the shoulder is too bulky. Ahead of the hook the finger is up to ~3 mm wider outboard than 1.20.
- **The handle is longer** (2.6). Same plate, feet, strap slots, stop strip and slide-in across the finger as 2.5, but
  floor to floor + `span_over` it is now **67.4 mm** (2.5: 41.8). The strap slots stay centred on it.

## Parts

| Part | STL (assembled pose / print) |
|---|---|
| Right finger (1.21) | `exports/parts/right.stl` / `exports/print/right.stl` |
| Left finger (mirror) | `exports/parts/left.stl` / `exports/print/left.stl` |
| Right handle | `exports/parts/right_slide.stl` / `exports/print/right_slide.stl` |
| Left handle | `exports/parts/left_slide.stl` / `exports/print/left_slide.stl` |

## Checks (all pass)

`python3 export_models.py && python3 genus.py && python3 check_geometry.py`: every 2.5 check (meshes watertight, 33
finger holes + 2 handle holes, fingers never collide 1-30 deg, point-only contact, taper, handle seats, slides in across the
finger without touching, held by both prongs, both floors and the stop strip).

## Not verified

Nothing printed. The wider shoulder ahead of the top hook isn't checked against a hand or anything the finger closes on.
2.5's caveats stand: only friction stops the handle sliding back out the way it came, the 0.2 mm fit is nominal, and
the prongs haven't been pull-tested.

2.5's README follows.

# Generalist Gripper · Version 2.5: spanning handle

voice-56f9d73f. Jake: *"Bring the handles down further, and make the handle piece extend higher up, so it spans between the
gripper's bottom and top hooks and slides in to be captured by both."*

2.5 is 2.4 (`v204_generalist_parametric`: every dimension in `params.json`, the Tune panel) on 1.20's fingers
(`v020_generalist_double_hook`: 1.19's wide beak, 1.18's flat-bottom taper, and a top hook mirroring the base J-hook).
The finger STL is byte-identical to 1.20's.

## What changed from 2.4

- **1.20's fingers.** `trace_photo.py` gains 1.20's `top_hook()`. `params.json` takes 1.19/1.20's values:
  `outer_lean_deg` 15, `outer_start_handle` 0.50, `outer_end_handle` 0.25, `outer_bow` 0.20, `tip_thick` 2.4, and
  `contact_back` 0.0005 (calibration). New outline param `top_hook_mirror_u` (8.5) slides the top hook along the edge.
- **One handle spans both hooks.** The black plate (3.5 mm, 37 mm across, two strap slots, as 2.2-2.4) now runs the whole
  straight outer edge, from the base notch floor to the top notch floor plus `span_over` (1 mm) at each end: 41.8 mm long
  (2.4: 28). That's lower at the bottom (its foot now reaches the base notch's floor, 2.4 stopped 0.8 mm short) and 13.8 mm
  higher at the top. The finger outline grown by `fit` trims each end into a foot that fills one notch.
  `slide_len` and `slide_u0` are gone: the plate's length follows the hooks.
- **It slides in across the finger.** The two hooks face each other, so nothing can slide in along the edge any more. So 2.3's
  tongue and keyhole pocket are gone (with their 10 params), and the hooks do their job: both hold the handle along the edge
  and against outboard pull. The handle slides on across the finger's thickness from the flat (ventral) side, like 1.20's
  blank. With no pocket, the finger no longer breaks into 4 honeycomb holes.
- **A stop strip.** New `stop_depth` (1.5) and `stop_width` (2): a strip on the plate's inboard face, along its ventral side.
  It trails the slide-in, and when the handle is home it butts against the ventral face, so the handle can't slide on
  through. `stop_depth` 0 removes it. In 1.20, only friction held the blank.

## Parts

| Part | STL (assembled pose / print) |
|---|---|
| Right finger | `exports/parts/right.stl` / `exports/print/right.stl` |
| Left finger (mirror) | `exports/parts/left.stl` / `exports/print/left.stl` |
| Right handle | `exports/parts/right_slide.stl` / `exports/print/right_slide.stl` |
| Left handle | `exports/parts/left_slide.stl` / `exports/print/left_slide.stl` |

`gripper.scad` `part=` adds `handle_sliding` (with `handle_slide` = mm still to go). Print the fingers flat on the ventral face.

## Checks (all pass)

`python3 export_models.py && python3 genus.py && python3 check_geometry.py`: every 2.4 / 1.20 finger check, plus:

- the seated handle clears the finger;
- it slides in from 26 mm out on the ventral side, in 1 mm steps, without touching;
- pushed 0.5 mm outboard it hits both prongs, toward either hook that notch's floor, and on through, the stop strip
  hits the ventral face;
- the finger has 33 through-holes (1.20's) and the handle has 2.

`live_render.py` with no overrides reproduces the exported STLs, and with `top_hook_mirror_u` changed it re-traces (~1 s).

## Not verified

Nothing has been printed. Only friction keeps the handle from sliding back out the way it came in. The 0.2 mm fit is
nominal, and the prongs (1.19 base-hook size, about 2.2 mm deep) haven't been pull-tested.
